Well, so after years chasing this "dream" (?) I finally I have a good website, self made, beautiful, with the things that I use and without a messy WYSIWYG editor which does what he wants. So as everybody knows, my editor is [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and I'm using github's markdown as formating syntax to write this whole website.

How I did this? Well, this site is now automatically generated by a 162 lines [python script](https://github.com/nomius/nomius.github.io/blob/master/generator.py). Cool isn't it? :-)

You don't believe me? Take a look at the whole code and website (+content) at: <https://github.com/nomius/nomius.github.io>.

This website support links (doh!), it has an automated weblog created, it uses a clean syntax that you really enjoy writing in like markdown, it also support syntax highlight for programming, mobile support (?) as it use bootstrap under the hood and one of the nicest things, it has a really nice design.

If you want to use this code to create your own site, please, go ahead, it's free software.

Also, this is something I did last year, all my projects are now in [GitHub](http://www.github.com), and sure, this site as well is hosted on GitHub pages.
Let me list them and give some explainations:

 * [ntunnel](https://github.com/nomius/ntunnel): Simple tunnel protocol with RSA keys, signed digests and blowfish cipher using the OpenSSL library and the tuntap device from the Linux kernel and its API.

 * [kpkg](https://github.com/nomius/kpkg): kpkg is the binary Kwort package manager. It allows you to install, remove and download and upgrade packages. This is one of Kwort's holy grail.

 * [misctools](https://github.com/nomius/misctools): Interesting miscellaneous scripts (service command for Kwort, a simple virtualization manager, a wireless network manager, a tool to work with certificates, etc...)

 * [dmemory](https://github.com/nomius/dmemory): Dynamic memory management C library (educative project). This is an \*alloc functions' wrapper. the [test file](https://github.com/nomius/dmemory/blob/master/test.c) and source code is pretty much self explainatory.

 * [nqqueue](https://github.com/nomius/nqqueue): NQqueue is a modular, threaded and plugeable queue for Qmail allowing the user to write their own filters for spam, virus, etc. This is one of the coolest projects I have worked on.

 * [mttools](https://github.com/nomius/mttools): A couple of years back, when I started playing around with text formating languages I came up with some basic tools to use the Troff -ms macros. This is a small project that includes a C and Shell troff parser.

 * [nomius.github.io](https://github.com/nomius/nomius.github.io): This site and weblog.

 * [kwtools](https://github.com/nomius/kwtools): Kwort tools is a set of scripts and applications used in Kwort < 2.4.2, including package manager, user and network manager. This code is now really old and unmaintained but it has some really useful gtkdialog code that I used in the [misctools](https://github.com/nomius/misctools).

 * [Kwort](http://www.kwort.org): Kwort is a modern and fast Linux distribution that combines powerful and useful applications in order to create a simple system for advanced users who finds a strong and effective desktop. Kwort is based on CRUX, so it's robust, clean and easy to extend. Of course, not hosted at github. ;-)
