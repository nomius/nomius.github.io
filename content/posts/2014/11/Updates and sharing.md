Hey all!
Last week (and also today) I made a major upgrade to Kwort 4.1.
This should bring your system to the latest version. So in your system you can just run:

```
kpkg upgrade
```

Also, I would like to share a really cool site for designers: <http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/>

When creating this site I needed a nice palette color and that tool/site really helped me on doing that; so, enjoy it :-)

Anyways, I'll be on PTO tomorrow and probably disconnected (or I'll do my best to stay away of the computer :-D).

Stay cool and have fun!
