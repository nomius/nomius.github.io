I just released ktsuss 1.2. There's not much to say about this new version. The most important changes were made to the GUI which now uses a native gtk dialog instead of a custom window. (Thanks to Christian Dywan for the patch).
Ktsuss now allows running applications as any user instead of root only. The code was in the authentication backend, now it is used in the GUI.
Added to the main launcher are options -v, --version, -h, and --help.You can read the full changelog and download the new version here: (http://developer.berlios.de/projects/ktsuss)
