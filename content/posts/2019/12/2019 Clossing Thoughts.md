This has been quite a year for me. In my personal and profesional life and in the open source projects I maintain.

I'm not gonna gonna get into details of my personal and profesional life but on the open source projects, and the one I'm focused mainly is Kwort as it is the one I use every day.

Kwort 4.3.3 (released on 2018 and now considered legacy) and 4.3.4 (released on 2019) has been a releases I've been very proud of in terms of stability and security. For these two patches coming out from developers has been distributed for Kwort daily or with a two-days delay in worst case scenarios.

Kwort 4.3.4 included some interesting new in-house built tool packaged separately which helped streamlining the packaging architecture and for the first time we shipped PulseAudio; we keep shipping our very simple, flexible and rock-solid package manager (last bug discovered and fixed was like 2 years ago).

Often people ask me why I develop Kwort and I'll be honest with you all: I don't think there are more than 10 people out there using Kwort these days on daily basis. Other major distributions (like Debian/Ubuntu/derivatives, Arch or Fedora) has eaten all user base, and I guess that's fine. One of the main reasons why I keep developing it is because it allows me to trust 100% in what I'm running, meaning that I build the system, I build my own kernel, I choose every software I want to use and carefully pick out all their dependencies based on my regular use case. I use 3 or 4 computers and packaging the software I use allows me to distribute what I use easily among them.
People asked me also a lot "Why don't you use Ubuntu or Arch?", I don't trust Ubuntu (specially after the whole "Ubuntu Online" sending search details to Amazon) although I think it's a great system with lots of software availability and easy for users; and for Arch, I don't know, it looks like a good distribution, I might try it (don't take this literally :-) ), but I'll keep doing Kwort because that's what I do and how I keep learning and trying new things in the Linux world; that is another main reason why I keep developing it.

So anyways, Kwort needs a new site... As you see the old site is gone (because of an issue) and my good old friend Andreas Schipplock did an incredible job restoring most of the site from the Google cache and web archive and wrapped everything in like a day in the site we currently have. Seriously Andreas, I don't know how you did that in a couple of hours :-) and thank you!
If no one is jumping in offering to build something, my idea is probably to do rough plain html and see if I can find a template around I could use. I found a really nice template and started to migrate the existing site into it but it just looks way off and weird, I don't know if it's because it looks very professional (Kwort is more a geeky stuff) or if it doesn't represent what Kwort is; heck! I could even use this python site generator to build the new site... So anyways if someone is interested me, please drop me an email (<dcortarello@gmail.com>).

So, to close this incredible year I want to thank everyone and share best wishes to all, it has been a very nice year.

Happy new year!
