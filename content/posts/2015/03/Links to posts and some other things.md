Hi folks, two weeks ago it was requested on github to implement links to posts. Today I implemented this feature with id's.

In the last couple of days I've been playing with gpg (I was always using openssl's enc/dec/sign(dgst) instead). I want to start using a Keyserver, but I want a reliable one outside the US and UK, so MIT's kinda out of the table. Anyone knows any? I'm thinking in <http://keys.connectical.com>, which looks like be running in France (*I don't trust too much in France anyways*) as I like what the Connectical guys had created. I'm open to comments and ideas.

Also, I would like to share a really cool site that I've been reading: <http://theoldschooldevops.com>, you guys knows that I like old school stuff :-)

Enjoy!
