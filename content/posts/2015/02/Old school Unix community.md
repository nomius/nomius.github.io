For those who read this weblog and use Ubuntu or any kind of of userbase like that, you can't stop reading here, as this is going to be an "Ubuntu rant" and you'll probably will not like this.

As most of you know, I'm pretty old school Unix programmer I tend to do clean development and have everything done just right. As a developer I sit on top of the Unix interface (when doing userspace development) in order to support as much as possible.

In the last few years we saw Ubuntu coming, in the beginning it was only a remake of Debian with more power on the User interface. What made it so wide used? Well, they made two things really good. The first one was delivering a copy of the Ubuntu CD-ROM to everyone who requested it for free, there were some who requested for docens and distributed it among their friends, I have seen people playing frisbee with it anyways. The second one was thinking more in the users as users and not developers; that was a big hit.

So I guess it was easier to install (I've never installed it) and you could have it for free really quickly if you didn't want to or could't download it, and if not, there's was someone near to you always with a CD-ROM with it.
For a lot of people, that was great as it brought a lot of new users to Linux. But the problem here is that old school users/developers like me don't care about the quantity but about the quality. And unfortunately, the quality of Linux users that Ubuntu brought compared to other distributions was disastrous. Why? Because a user didn't have to worry about learning the OS anymore, but only focusing in using it and unfortunately, for them, there's Ubuntu, not Linux or other distribution, they use Ubuntu and that's the only thing besides Windows/OS-X out there.

Working on Kwort's new aspect for future releases, I have no idea why I got into this "thing" called [Plank](http://wiki.go-docky.com/?title=Plank:Introduction), which looks like a docker for docky (which apparently is a launcher bar). Now, this was developed by "one of those users". Their developers are like "Ubuntu is what we support only" (probably because they think that Ubuntu is the "only" Linux), and let me quote them:

> Do not report bugs if you are using Gentoo-based, Pacman-based, or Slackware-based distributions - only Ubuntu/OpenSUSE (and their derivatives) and Fedora are currently supported

Plank developers: I'm never going to use Plank probably, at least not by personal choice; but please, do yourself a favor and learn the system you're developing in. Why restricting the support to what you use only? It looks like you have no idea how Unix works and how to really develop in it (and I'm pretty sure I'm right).

I'm still working on future's Kwort looks, I'll probably write something like that in the next few days, but don't worry folks, we'll still be minimal ;-)
