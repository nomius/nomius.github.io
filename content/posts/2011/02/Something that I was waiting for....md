I want to share something with you guys...
Last week (sorry for the delay) I got an email from Jorgen Thomsen telling me that gnu-pop3d was released:

> Hello
> I just released GNU -pop3d 0.9.13 which is a more stable release than 0.9.12
> <http://jth.net/virtual.html>
> In a short time I will release 0.9.14 which will implement IPv6 support.

So great, a new gnu-pop3d is available, so I saw the changelog and I saw this:

> Bugfix: certain login methods did not work (David B. Cortarello)

Pretty happy about the merging of my patch into mainstream. Thanks Jorgen!

Cheers!
