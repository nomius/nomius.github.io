I'm just releasing NQqueue 0.3 beta.
This is just a bug fix release and it is beta because of the new spamassassin plugin; I wrote this one on sunday, but since I don't use spamassassin (I have servers running dspam), I can't test it.

This is just a release asking for people to flood my inbox with feedback on the spamassassin plugin, the configuration parameters are the same used with the dspam plugin, so only "pass" parameter is allowed, or empty.

So, get latest NQqueue release here: (http://europa.fapyd.unr.edu.ar/releases/NQqueue-0.3b.tar.gz)
