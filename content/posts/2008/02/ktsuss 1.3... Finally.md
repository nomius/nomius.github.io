Well, today I'm releasing the new ktsuss.
It toke quite some time, not because it was too much work, but because I didn't the enough time to finish it.
This new version includes the new authentication backend, and the new interface, which I have to say it's quite better than the old one. The main setuid program has a better comand line parser, not for the user, but if someone wants to understand it, is quite easy.

I would like to thank Christian Dywan for putting so much work in the graphical interface, he made an excellent job with it. I would like to thank too to all the people who reported bugs to make this release the best one.
