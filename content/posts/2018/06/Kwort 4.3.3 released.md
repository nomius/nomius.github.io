Kwort 4.3.3 is out

Final highlights:

* Everything is up to date as you expect, toolchain, kernel (latest 4.14 LTS -as of now 4.14.32-).
* Latest kpkg version with new features.
* Chromium 65 is our default browser now. 
* No Firefox and flash support.
* We are developing a cool set of tools called "kwort-choosers", which as of now provides things like: file chooser, browser's chooser, moc interface, etc, all using dmenu as UI.

Please head to [www.kwort.org](www.kwort.org) for the full announce and downloads.

Happy installing!
