Hello!

Wanted to share a couple of things.

First of all, there's a release candidate for the Kwort 4.3.5. Some small announcement [here](https://kwort.org/news.html), and downloads links are available [here](https://kwort.org/news.html). I know the current announcement is not a big thing, but for awareness the full announcement will be once the final release is out. This new version makes me proud, there's several fixes of issues I've seen on Kwort for quire a few years.

This year I presented at the [Nerdear.la](https://nerdear.la/en/) event on containers and the cloud. As soon as the presentation is on youtube I'll share the link... And yes, sorry, this one is in spanish.

As some of you might know, I'm an engineering manager since nearly a year now. I've taken a new role within the company I work for where I lead container's platforms globally. In this role I work and lead a team certifying containers platforms for internal use, my focus is pretty much on Kubernetes cloud services and other smaller "closed" container services like Fargate. My focus on this area is more on defining the consumption patterns of these services (mainly with terraform) so developers can use these services securely and effectively... I always say that our work should be giving the developers tools so they can work better and faster while not getting in their way.

Till the next one!
