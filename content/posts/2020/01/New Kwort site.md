Hey everyone!

Right, so I couldn't held myself and built a new Kwort site. I belive the new [https://kwort.org](https://kwort.org) looks really nice.

Some interesting points:

 * There's a new starting page and the [news](https://kwort.org/news.html) goes into a separated page.
 * New [screenshots](https://kwort.org/screenshots.html)... I believe the old ones were from Kwort 3.x.
 * New [documentation](https://kwort.org/documentation.html) covering better our tools.
 * The new [software](https://kwort.org/software.html) page is dynamic using an nginx file browsing parser I wrote in javascript (I always wanted to do that :-)).

Unfortunately www alias doesn't work yet (github, or should I say Microsoft now is working on it), so for now just stick to [https://kwort.org](https://kwort.org).

Oh, and I found out that there's more Kwort users out there. Really cool! :-)

Cheers!
