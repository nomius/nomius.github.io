I started using ttysnoop (it's like a vnc for consoles) at work but there was so troubles while compiling, so this patch fixes errors, warnings and adds things to Makefile to make it more flexible and able to compile the program itself, read the comments in the patch for a more detailed information.
And please, if someone finds Carl Declerck's email (another than carl[@]miskatonic[.]inbe[.]net), send this patch to him or drop a comment here reporting me his real mail, since I couldn't send him the patch because his email address doesn't exists anymore. 

If you want to start using it you'll probably want to apply this patch.

I leave you the link here:
