<p>Andreas Schipplock (aka Avaurus) is working on the core system and as far as I know he is making a remarkable work on it.
One of the most important parts is the lzma compression for the packages, so the final iso will be smaller than the Kwort 2.2 one. He is now working on the installation system, so when he gets done I'll put Kwort desktop on it.</p>

<p>Stijn Segers is working on the new interface for the users admin system (as my mockup looked very bad :-P), so once he finishes with it I will make a Xfce plugin of it and include it in the mcs settings manager.
He will also take care of the kernel. So this time, getting kernel source to compile drivers won't be needed and as he told me we will include some drivers by default like those free ralink ones. But kernel work stopped until 2.6.23 come out, as that one will be the one for Kwort 2.4.</p>

<p>And it's time to tell what I'm doing... Well, until Andreas and Stijn doesn't finish I'm still maintaining 2.2 serie including and upgrading packages <a href="http://www.kwort.org/?page=MorePackages">http://www.kwort.org/?page=MorePackages</a>.</p>

<p>But until that happens I'm checking projects and taking decisions for the desktop and in core (helping Andreas and Stijn). Today I did some user custom actions for kwort packages:</p>

<p><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/dcortarello/kpkg_install.png" alt="Installing Kwort packages from the file manager" /></p>

<p>For those paranoids (I know you guys are right about this), ktsuss will be included and all those sudo commands will be removed (sudo will still be included, but not used for anything else but xfsm-shutdown-helper). So this custom action showed above use ktsuss in case you ask.</p>

<p>Oh, another interesting things are the fact that kwort is listed in <www.xfce.org/download/distros> as a Xfce distribution and Kwort being used in school (COBAEH - Cuautepec de Hinojosa - Hidalgo - Mexico) with old machines (Pentium MMX 200Mhz with 32MB ram).</p>

<p>Well, that's all for now folks, I will keep bringing Kwort newsflash :)</p>

<h3>The IT Crowd for download</h3><h6>Posted on: Jul 2007</h6><p>The last week I started to see a tv serie called "The IT Crowd" on Sony, it's a funny geek serie about an IT team in a british company. Anyways, a friend of mine (Manu) wanted to download all the chapters from a site, so I wrote this simple script for him:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

wget http://stage6.divx.com/The-IT-Crowd---Spanish-Subtitled/videos/
i=1
for x in $(egrep -i "The-IT-Crowd---1x0*" index.html | awk -F '/' '{ print $4}' | sort -m -u); do
   tput setaf 1
   echo "Downloading chapter ${i} (Link: http://divx-226.vo.llnwd.net/stage6vid/${x}.divx)"
   tput sgr0
   wget http://divx-226.vo.llnwd.net/stage6vid/${x}.divx --output-file="${i}.avi"
   i=$((i+1))
done
</code></pre>

<p>I hope someone find it useful.</p>

<p>EDIT: Unfortunately, this doesn't work anymore, since stage6 was closed.</p>

<h3>Knowing the network speed at a given moment</h3><h6>Posted on: Jul 2007</h6><p>Well, a friend of mine asked me for this, and it was very interesting to understand what was in /proc/net/dev.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "${1}" ]; then
   echo "Give a network interface"
   exit 1
fi
DEV=${1}
/sbin/ifconfig ${DEV} &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "Please, do man 8 ifconfig to know what a network interface is"
   exit 1
fi
LINE_OLD=$(cat /proc/net/dev | grep ${DEV})
sleep 1
LINE_NEW=$(cat /proc/net/dev | grep ${DEV})
while [ "${LINE_OLD}" = "${LINE_NEW}" ]; do
   sleep 0.1
   LINE_NEW=$(cat /proc/net/dev | grep ${DEV})
done
OLD_DOWN=$(echo ${LINE_OLD/*:/} | awk -F " " '{ print $1 }')
OLD_UP=$(echo ${LINE_OLD/*:/} | awk -F " " '{ print $9 }')
NEW_DOWN=$(echo ${LINE_NEW/*:/} | awk -F " " '{ print $1 }')
NEW_UP=$(echo ${LINE_NEW/*:/} | awk -F " " '{ print $9 }')
REST_DOWN=$((${NEW_DOWN} - ${OLD_DOWN}))
REST_UP=$((${NEW_UP} - ${OLD_UP}))
if [ ${REST_DOWN} -gt 1024 ]; then
   echo "DOWNLOAD: $(echo "scale=2;${REST_DOWN}/1024" | bc -lq)k/s"
else
   echo "DOWNLOAD: ${REST_DOWN}b/s"
fi
if [ ${REST_UP} -gt 1024 ]; then
   echo "UPLOAD: $(echo "scale=2;${REST_UP}/1024" | bc -lq)k/s"
else
   echo "UPLOAD: ${REST_UP}b/s"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>You can run it this way for example:</p>

<pre><code>while true; do ./netspeed eth0; done
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think this is really reliable, but anyways, see you guys in the next few days to tell you something new :)</p>

<h3>Here we go again with margins in openbox</h3><h6>Posted on: Jun 2007</h6><p>I wrote a patch for openbox 3.3.1 at the very beginning of the year which was rejected by the openbox leader (to me the reasons wasn't right, but it is his project :-P).
So a new release of openbox was released some weeks ago and yes, as you guess, that patch isn't compatible with the new version (3.4), so I re-wrote the patch to work.</p>

<p>The configuration is made in the same way as before in the rc.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;margin&gt;
  &lt;top&gt;px&lt;/top&gt;
  &lt;bottom&gt;px&lt;/bottom&gt;
  &lt;left&gt;px&lt;/left&gt;
  &lt;right&gt;px&lt;/right&gt;
&lt;/margin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, here it is, patch supporting margins in openbox 3.4: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/openbox-3.4.0-margins.patch">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/openbox-3.4.0-margins.patch</a></p>

<p>Thanks to all the people asking me for this, as it inspiring.</p>

<h3>Firefox freshmeat.net search plugin</h3><h6>Posted on: Jun 2007</h6><p>A long time since my last post, looks like that was from the caves times. :-P
Anyways, I was boring in this almost winter afternoon, so I started to see what I could do in a short amount of time. So I wrote a small search plugin for Firefox, so I can search for projects in freshmeat.net, you can get it from here:</p>

<h3>My new tool: ktsuss... A simple graphic su</h3><h6>Posted on: Apr 2007</h6><p>I know I had to write something about the wake on lan software I was writing. I think it is done, but couldn't test it yet, so I don't wanna rush me and write about it and show it in case it doesn't work, so please stay tunned and wait a bit longer.</p>

<p>So, today I will show and talk you about a new thing I was doing these days.
I started working on a replacement for gksu. gksu is like a graphical su. I was trying to understand it and make it work well enough, but I don't know what was in the mind of the gksu's developers, because what they did was a really wrong approach, I don't know why they wrote first a library and then the application (maybe for plugins, I'm just paraphrasing) , but anyways,
together they are more than 500k, which is extremely too much.
So I wrote my version of gksu, which is called ktsuss (keep the su simple, stupid). My version is only the setuid wrapper (as GTK doesn't permit setuid programs) and program itself which is less than 3k.
As I know you guys love screenshots, this is how the program looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7bn3_3YdSWU/RirMWAa4iZI/AAAAAAAAAE0/bjUfY8bq2Ek/s320/ktsuss.png" alt="ktsuss 1.0 screenshow" /></p>

<p>Anyways, I would like to get feedback on this, so please, let me know if it fails or anything is or goes wrong on it.</p>

<p>Get the program from here: <a href="http://dcortarello.googlepages.com/ktsuss-1.0.tar.gz">http://dcortarello.googlepages.com/ktsuss-1.0.tar.gz</a></p>

<h3>A month latter... Finally, patch for wavemon</h3><h6>Posted on: Apr 2007</h6><p>It's been quite a while since my last post here...</p>

<p>Some things happened like the release of Kwort 2.2 (not as great as I would like, but still good). New knm will be released in the next few days, this will be just a bug fix release (too many thanks to the people from tuxmachines, who thanks to them I saw some bugs).</p>

<p>I've been developing on clip at work, which is an interesting and exciting thing, since this is my first time working on compilers (I started last year when I wrote some patches for compatibilities and bug fixes).</p>

<p>Well, now on to businesses and the important stuff. As I said like a month ago I was working on a patch for wavemon, which is a software that I consider very good, with a nice and clean code. I would have released it before, but I was studying and working a lot, so I only have the weekends, and as I been working on Kwort I couldn't work on this before.</p>

<p>So, as it says in the patch, the following bug fixes and features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed errors compilation in gcc 3.x due to default label missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed some warnings due to the lvalue casts deprecated on gcc 3.x.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed ap list functions, so now it use the new iw api (this is the most important thing).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last change is the most important, as it made the code simpler, now it works with all cards because the new wireless tools extensions are up to date.</p>

<p>Get the patch from here: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/wavemon-0.4.0b-comp-fix-new-ap.patch">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/wavemon-0.4.0b-comp-fix-new-ap.patch</a></p>

<p>And for those that don't know wavemon, you can get the source code from here: <a href="http://www.janmorgenstern.de/wavemon-current.tar.gz">http://www.janmorgenstern.de/wavemon-current.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>I hope you guys find it useful like I do. :)</p>

<h3>Kwort Linux (to be released) and Kpkg (released)</h3><h6>Posted on: Mar 2007</h6><p>Kpkg 2.4 was released some minutes ago, you can download it from here: <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/kpkg/kpkg-2.4.tar.gz">http://prdownload.berlios.de/kpkg/kpkg-2.4.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>This version is a bug fix release, now PKG<em>GOOD and PKG</em>FAIL works with upgrade as it should and I fixed a weird issue due to a scope problem in bash functions.</p>

<p>As usual, release notes and Changelog can be found <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?group_id=7171&amp;release_id=12417">here</a></p>

<p>That's about Kpkg. Now, let's go to the important business. Kwort 2.2 final version will be released in the next couple of hours as some bugs (I hope no more appear) were fixed. The most important upgrades of this final version are kpkg and dialog. Not important upgrades were aaa_base and freedesktop packages that were modified to avoid annoying messages during the install.</p>

<h3>Kwort network manager 2.0 released</h3><h6>Posted on: Feb 2007</h6><p>Has been like a lifetime since I wrote something here, sorry folks, I been studying and working a lot.</p>

<p>I just released knm 2.0, I tried to do this for the last two weeks, but there was some problems with releases at berlios (unless that happened when I tried to release this new version of knm).
No many improvements made, several bug fixes and some information dialogs.</p>

<p>You can see the release notes with the changelog here: <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?group_id=8115&amp;release_id=12311">Changelog and release notes</a></p>

<p>And you can download this new release at here: <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/knm/knm-2.0.tar.gz">Download</a></p>

<p>In other news, Kwort 2.2rc2 have been released, check Kwort site at my right or <a href="http://www.kwort.org/">here</a> (Thanks to Josep Subils Rigau who keep both the domains (.com and .org) registered). Please, if you're gonna download the iso, use Andreas's (aka avarus) mirror, as it is faster.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm working in a patch for wavemon (<a href="http://www.janmorgenstern.de/projects-software.html">http://www.janmorgenstern.de/projects-software.html</a>), I already fixed any gcc incompatibilities but I'm still working trying to fix the ap list feature, because as it says in the source code it should be changed to the new 2.6 kernel api.</p>

<p>That's all for today... Stay tuned. ;)</p>

<h3>Kwort Linux new logo</h3><h6>Posted on: Feb 2007</h6><p>Not really programming, unix and/or math, this is like <em>off-topic</em> for this weblog, but Kwort's related, so for transition, Unix related. :D</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that Kwort Linux has now a new logo.
Some weeks ago, Julio Cesar Puigpinos wrote to a mailing list the idea of create a new logo for Kwort.
Only one person sent me some sketches, and this was Fabricio Caiazza. He made two logos and sent those to me, the first one looked like a friendly ghost and the second one (a weird penguin) who was the one who won.
I would have liked to have more logos from which to choose, not because Fabricio's logo isn't nice (it is actually great btw), but the fact of having more logos means that the community wants to help. I'm not making a judgment here, maybe the community doesn't like arts, but it would be nice to get some help sometimes...</p>

<p>Anyways, no more talking, the logo:
<img src="http://kwort.org/pub/skins/ssofb.co.uk_joomla_rhuk/kworty.png" alt="Kwort logo" /></p>

<p>In other news, Andreas Schipplock is making a new site with several languages support (I'm not sure, but I think he finished the languages support code today) for those who instead of help come with criticism and complainings about this issue (you guys know who you are, and I only feel shame for you).</p>
