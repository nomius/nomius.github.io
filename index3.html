What about their childs"><h3>The childs of my son are my enemies... What about their childs</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Nov 2007</h6><p>I had to deal with this problem related to process sincronization some months ago, and since Kwort 2.4 core edition is waiting for Linux 2.6.24, I will show you what my problem was and how I dealed with it.</p>

<p>I was trying to run a process, this process forks itself and ran some bash scripts. So far there's nothing bad on it, the problem is that those shell scripts create some childs, and it is more than sure that the parent (the main script) die before the childs, so I'll get some orphans process. And the main C program shouldn't die before all the childs die.</p>

<p>So, let's take for example the code in the first post in this blog "Checking the network with bash". In this case a wait in the end would fix the problem, but let's just think that we can't modify this script:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><code><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span class="k">function</span> pinging<span class="o">(){</span>
    <span class="nv">SUBNET</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">1</span><span class="si">}</span>

<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, this was the first attempt to control this mess but unfortunately didn't work as expected because this process was in another Process Group ID (avoid comments about controlling the return value of fork and such, since this is an example of something that didn't work):</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[]){</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fork</span><span class="p">())</span>
        <span class="n">waitpid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">getpgrp</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="n">execlp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, basically, the idea was that the main C program shown above shouldn't die until all the childrens of the scripts die (that's why I was using using getpgrp(), which didn't work as expected for what I explained above).
On Linux, running ps axfj, showed me that the small childrens (those one generated by the script) are in the same group, but I couldn't wait for them, as they are not my childrens, but then child of my child process children's.</p>

<p>After dealing a little of time I came up whit this program that control all the childrens, grandchildrens and rest of the "family". The code is very simple to understand and explains on itself:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[]){</span>

<p>Thanks to Marcel, who actually helped me a lot with some concepts and ideas to find a workaround to this.</p>

<br><a id="ktsuss 1.2 released"><br></a><a href="#ktsuss 1.2 released"><h3>ktsuss 1.2 released</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Sep 2007</h6><p>I just released ktsuss 1.2. There's not much to say about this new version. The most important changes were made to the GUI which now uses a native gtk dialog instead of a custom window. (Thanks to Christian Dywan for the patch).
Ktsuss now allows running applications as any user instead of root only. The code was in the authentication backend, now it is used in the GUI.
Added to the main launcher are options -v, --version, -h, and --help.You can read the full changelog and download the new version here: <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/ktsuss">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/ktsuss</a></p>

<br><a id="Some flashlights of Kwort 2.4"><br></a><a href="#Some flashlights of Kwort 2.4"><h3>Some flashlights of Kwort 2.4</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Aug 2007</h6><p>Well, me and the rest of the team are working in Kwort 2.4 (2.2.2? I dunno, but I think 2.4 will be alright).</p>

<p>Andreas Schipplock (aka Avaurus) is working on the core system and as far as I know he is making a remarkable work on it.
One of the most important parts is the lzma compression for the packages, so the final iso will be smaller than the Kwort 2.2 one. He is now working on the installation system, so when he gets done I'll put Kwort desktop on it.</p>

<p>Stijn Segers is working on the new interface for the users admin system (as my mockup looked very bad :-P), so once he finishes with it I will make a Xfce plugin of it and include it in the mcs settings manager.
He will also take care of the kernel. So this time, getting kernel source to compile drivers won't be needed and as he told me we will include some drivers by default like those free ralink ones. But kernel work stopped until 2.6.23 come out, as that one will be the one for Kwort 2.4.</p>

<p>And it's time to tell what I'm doing... Well, until Andreas and Stijn doesn't finish I'm still maintaining 2.2 serie including and upgrading packages <a href="http://www.kwort.org/?page=MorePackages">http://www.kwort.org/?page=MorePackages</a>.</p>

<p>But until that happens I'm checking projects and taking decisions for the desktop and in core (helping Andreas and Stijn). Today I did some user custom actions for kwort packages:</p>

<p><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/dcortarello/kpkg_install.png" alt="Installing Kwort packages from the file manager" /></p>

<p>For those paranoids (I know you guys are right about this), ktsuss will be included and all those sudo commands will be removed (sudo will still be included, but not used for anything else but xfsm-shutdown-helper). So this custom action showed above use ktsuss in case you ask.</p>

<p>Oh, another interesting things are the fact that kwort is listed in <www.xfce.org/download/distros> as a Xfce distribution and Kwort being used in school (COBAEH - Cuautepec de Hinojosa - Hidalgo - Mexico) with old machines (Pentium MMX 200Mhz with 32MB ram).</p>

<p>Well, that's all for now folks, I will keep bringing Kwort newsflash :)</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><code><span class="nt">&lt;margin&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;top&gt;</span>px<span class="nt">&lt;/top&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;bottom&gt;</span>px<span class="nt">&lt;/bottom&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;left&gt;</span>px<span class="nt">&lt;/left&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;right&gt;</span>px<span class="nt">&lt;/right&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/margin&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, here it is, patch supporting margins in openbox 3.4: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/openbox-3.4.0-margins.patch">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/openbox-3.4.0-margins.patch</a></p>

<p>Thanks to all the people asking me for this, as it inspiring.</p>

Anyways, I was boring in this almost winter afternoon, so I started to see what I could do in a short amount of time. So I wrote a small search plugin for Firefox, so I can search for projects in freshmeat.net, you can get it from here:</p>

A simple graphic su</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Apr 2007</h6><p>I know I had to write something about the wake on lan software I was writing. I think it is done, but couldn't test it yet, so I don't wanna rush me and write about it and show it in case it doesn't work, so please stay tunned and wait a bit longer.</p>

<p>So, today I will show and talk you about a new thing I was doing these days.
I started working on a replacement for gksu. gksu is like a graphical su. I was trying to understand it and make it work well enough, but I don't know what was in the mind of the gksu's developers, because what they did was a really wrong approach, I don't know why they wrote first a library and then the application (maybe for plugins, I'm just paraphrasing) , but anyways,
together they are more than 500k, which is extremely too much.
So I wrote my version of gksu, which is called ktsuss (keep the su simple, stupid). My version is only the setuid wrapper (as GTK doesn't permit setuid programs) and program itself which is less than 3k.
As I know you guys love screenshots, this is how the program looks like:</p>

<p>Anyways, I would like to get feedback on this, so please, let me know if it fails or anything is or goes wrong on it.</p>

<p>Get the program from here: <a href="http://dcortarello.googlepages.com/ktsuss-1.0.tar.gz">http://dcortarello.googlepages.com/ktsuss-1.0.tar.gz</a></p>

<br><a id="A month latter... Finally, patch for wavemon"><br></a><a href="#A month latter... Finally, patch for wavemon"><h3>A month latter... Finally, patch for wavemon</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Apr 2007</h6><p>It's been quite a while since my last post here...</p>

<p>Some things happened like the release of Kwort 2.2 (not as great as I would like, but still good). New knm will be released in the next few days, this will be just a bug fix release (too many thanks to the people from tuxmachines, who thanks to them I saw some bugs).</p>

<p>I've been developing on clip at work, which is an interesting and exciting thing, since this is my first time working on compilers (I started last year when I wrote some patches for compatibilities and bug fixes).</p>

<p>Well, now on to businesses and the important stuff. As I said like a month ago I was working on a patch for wavemon, which is a software that I consider very good, with a nice and clean code. I would have released it before, but I was studying and working a lot, so I only have the weekends, and as I been working on Kwort I couldn't work on this before.</p>

<p>So, as it says in the patch, the following bug fixes and features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed errors compilation in gcc 3.x due to default label missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed some warnings due to the lvalue casts deprecated on gcc 3.x.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed ap list functions, so now it use the new iw api (this is the most important thing).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last change is the most important, as it made the code simpler, now it works with all cards because the new wireless tools extensions are up to date.</p>

<p>Get the patch from here: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/wavemon-0.4.0b-comp-fix-new-ap.patch">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/wavemon-0.4.0b-comp-fix-new-ap.patch</a></p>

<p>And for those that don't know wavemon, you can get the source code from here: <a href="http://www.janmorgenstern.de/wavemon-current.tar.gz">http://www.janmorgenstern.de/wavemon-current.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>I hope you guys find it useful like I do. :)</p>

<p>This version is a bug fix release, now PKG<em>GOOD and PKG</em>FAIL works with upgrade as it should and I fixed a weird issue due to a scope problem in bash functions.</p>

<p>As usual, release notes and Changelog can be found <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?group_id=7171&amp;release_id=12417">here</a></p>

<p>That's about Kpkg. Now, let's go to the important business. Kwort 2.2 final version will be released in the next couple of hours as some bugs (I hope no more appear) were fixed. The most important upgrades of this final version are kpkg and dialog. Not important upgrades were aaa_base and freedesktop packages that were modified to avoid annoying messages during the install.</p>
