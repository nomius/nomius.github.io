This weblog isn't over, but I been doing a lot of things and didn't got the time to write something.</p>

<p>Ok, things I've been doing:
* I wrote a new network manager for Kwort 2.4.2 (I'm already working on a new Kwort version), screenshots are coming
* I also wrote a new user manager for next Kwort also. Screenshots are ON the way. :-D
* A friend of mine (Jp) is working on a new init system which is very cool, so Kwort will use it.
* Bought a pretty cool (4 cores) new computer (Desktop). I would like to thank to the aircable.net people who helped me to buy my new computer with a donation. (A BIG THANKS TO YOU GUYS)
* Working... :-)</p>

<p>Anyways, I want here to point this link from my good old friend Andreas Schipplock, he made a small list of interesting links to read and/or hear.</p>

<br><a id="NQqueue? What is that?"><br></a><a href="#NQqueue? What is that?"><h3>NQqueue? What is that?</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Jun 2008</h6><p>As some people asked me the last few weeks what I've been doing I've decided to take some time to write this and explain what NQqueue (aka nqq) is all about.
Well, some of you maybe listened (or read) me telling that queues for qmail are bloated. We don't have several choices, there is just plain qmail-queue which is unfeatured, qmail-scanner (aka give me my CPU back) which is the bloatest one, and simscan which is kind of featured, fast, but not extensible at all, both of the last ones are buggy when getting an email with several
Rcpts (they only analyze one. Which is a big bug).
So, because of all this, I've been using simscan, I actually extended it from those 2000 lines to 4000 adding features. But it became so big, that it is hard to maintain and to trace errors in it.
This situation drove me nuts the last year so I decided "Why I don't just write my own qmail queue?". Well, NQqueue is the result of this self asked question.</p>

<p>Let me show you and tell you some of the features of NQq:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modular - not like simscan with a big file with all the problem.</li>
<li>Pluggable - this is what NQq is all about, it support the addition of plugins. There are some now in the darcs server.</li>
<li>Threaded - this is quite a nice feature for mails with several Rcpts, nqqueue triggers a thread for every Rcpt to be analyzed.</li>
<li>Fast - This is like simscan. But it improves it when analyzing more than one Rcpt because of the threads.</li>
<li>Secure and reliable - I been working quite a lot on this, since simscan has several bugs, and I didn't want this on NQq.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plugins: Well, some of you might be asking "Dude, nice, but how do I write a plugin for NQq?". Well, first of all, I have to tell you that there are two types of plugins:
1st. we have the general plugins. Those plugins are run to an email before to trigger all the threads for every rcpt. Why is this? Well, it would be dumb to call for example a clamav plugin for every user (in every thread). So for example we can write a plugin that should not care about the Rcpts and/or From, like clamav, since it depends on a general database.
2nd. besides of general plugins, there are also per user plugins. These plugins are run in every thread. This is the example of a spam plugin, since it depends on a special per user database.</p>

<p>So now I can show you a small general plugin to block a Sender:</p>

<pre><code>/* vim: set sw=4 sts=4 : */

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;nqqueue.h&gt;

#define PLUGIN_VERSION "1.0"
#define PLUGIN_NAME "black"
#define REJECTED_MESSAGE "Message rejected because of black list"

char *plugin_name()
{
    return strdup(PLUGIN_NAME);
}

char *plugin_version()
{
    return strdup(PLUGIN_VERSION);
}

/* Parameters:
 * params = a char pointer with parameters used to call the module (in this case, the email address to block).
 * mail = It's a char pointer to the filename that contains the email.
 * From = a char pointer with the From email address. (if it matchs the param, the mail would be blocked)
 * Rcpt = an union that contains space for a char pointer (if user pluing) or a pointer to a PUStruct
 *        struct (if general plugin).
 * general = a pointer to a RSStruct struct, which is structure with all the plugins and its return values
 *           already runned by general plugins
 * peruser = a pointer to a RSStruct struct, which is structure with all the plugins and its return values
 *           already runned by per user plugins
 */
struct ModReturn *plugin_init(char *params, const char *mail, const char *From, const union Tos Rcpt, \
                              struct RSStruct *general, struct RSStruct *peruser)
{
    struct ModReturn *ret = malloc(sizeof(struct ModReturn));

    ret-&gt;NewFile = NULL;
    if (!strcmp(params, From)) {
        ret-&gt;ret = 1;
        ret-&gt;rejected = 1;
        ret-&gt;message = strdup(REJECTED_MESSAGE);
    }
    else {
        ret-&gt;ret = 0;
        ret-&gt;rejected = 0;
        ret-&gt;message = NULL;
    }
    return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looks easy don't you think? So, how do we make NQqueue to load our plugin? Simple: in /var/qmail/control/general.cfb put a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>:black=billgates@microsoft.com
</code></pre>

<p>That will set the sender billgates@microsoft.com as a blocked server. In fact, this plugin acts just like a black list.
Now your question might be: And how can I block more? Well, you can call the plugin several times, like this:</p>

<pre><code>:black=billgates@microsoft.com;black=steveballmer@microsoft.com
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can modify the plugin_init function to allow more than one email (like black=billgates@microsoft.com,steveballmer@microsoft.com) and do some simple parsing with strtok.</p>

<p>As you can see it is very easy to write plugins for NQqueue. I know it stills need a lot of documentation, since at it is now, it's very poor in this aspect. The only documentation in NQqueue so far is a configuration scheme in the NQqueue darcs in case you want to know how to configure it right (it's very easy).</p>

<p>So, those are some of the features in NQqueue there are more of course, but those are enough to mention.
NQqueue needs a lot of testing, so I'm counting with all of you to run tests. Also documentation is needed, and it will take some time to me to write it, so people wanting to write documentation are welcome. Also people writing plugins, I wrote some which are already in my darcs server (a dspam, clamav, blacklist and quarantine) modules.</p>

<br><a id="Hanging up switches and bridges"><br></a><a href="#Hanging up switches and bridges"><h3>Hanging up switches and bridges</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Apr 2008</h6><p>This issue came up today with some people and I did affirmed that you can hang up your switch with some funny code...
How this come? Well, very simple, switches and bridges has a small stack (10 bytes per host connected to it) where they save IP and MAC addresses to know where to send a package once the sender and the receiver are known. So, once the first package is sent, a new entry in the stack was made. So now you know the "theory" I'll leave you to think how could this help you to hang it (Let me give you a hint: OVERFLOW).</p>

<p>Anyways, get the code you'll need to produce this overflow from here: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/pkinject">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/pkinject</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that you'll need the pktgen kernel module to run this.
See also that I did this 3 years ago with bash, not even C code, so it shows how easy is to generate network packages to produce this effect, which isn't a big deal when it comes to reproduce it, but to create a security policy to avoid it.</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>

<br><a id="Kwort 2.4 released"><br></a><a href="#Kwort 2.4 released"><h3>Kwort 2.4 released</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Mar 2008</h6><p>I'm proud to announce that Kwort 2.4 final version has been released after a very long time (more than a year). The system is very stable and very usable.</p>

<p>The core system is based on Slackware and provides a rock solid system, and it's also a great place to start making a full featured and usable desktop environment using Xfce.
This version includes several changes from 2.2 from a new toolchain to a completely new base system. The inclusion of hal provides a great way to communicate the hardware with the desktop making the system a lot more user friendly.</p>

<p>Good things in this new version:
* Hal: As I said before provides a lot of new features giving the desktop some kind of control of the hardware.
* New init system: Kwort 2.4 includes a new init system written mostly from scratch. Also it puts all the work together with the new service command.
* Linux 2.6.24.3: The latest stable version of the linux kernel.
* Kpkg: The new version of kpkg was re-written from scratch.
* Kwort User Manager: Provides a simple way to create and remove users with default Kwort templates.
* Xfce: This new version integrate great with hal.
* Ristretto: The image viewer of the Xfce project.
* Mplayer: The most famous video player on Linux is now included in the iso.
* Pidgin: The latest version of the best multiprotocol IM.
* Mpd+Gmpc: This is the new combo to play media files in Kwort. Just put your media files in ~/Music, go to gmpc, give update and play.</p>

<p>As in every old version now comes the things that I look forward to improving:
* Better support for wireless devices: This is not part of Kwort itself, but the kernel, but finally affects Kwort users.
* Amule: Once again amule is giving the hebbe-jeebes. There is no stable version of amule that works well enough with Kwort. The latest version is dated from middle of 2006 wich is very old and buggy with newer versions of wxGTK.</p>

<p>Screenshots available here: <a href="http://kwort.org/?n=Main.Screenshots">http://kwort.org/?n=Main.Screenshots</a></p>

<p>People who I would like to thank:
Andreas Schipplock for making and maintaining the website, mirroring the iso, working in Kwort core (he made most part of the job with Core) and bring lzma support to Kwort.
Stijn Seger for working in some packages like openntpd and the pm support. And writing the Kwort user manager.
I would like to give a special thanks to the users who ran tests specially to David Luskovec and Juan Martin Villanueva, if it wasn't for you guys, this iso would take even longer to come out.
Manuel Naranjo for reporting bugs, submiting patches for the new init system, hosting the iso and run test all along Kwort core.
Also, I would like to thank all the mirror providers: Ricardo Brisighelli for the development mirror in the UNR, Alberto Ferrer for the mirror in Emanon Linux and the AIRcable people for the mirror at aircable.net.
Finally, but not less important a very big THANKS to Patrick Volkerding for Slackware Linux, the system kwort is based on. I hope I didn't forget anyone.</p>

<p>As usual, if you need support, help, or you just feel like talking about Kwort (or anything else), or you just want to meet the people who is behind Kwort, you can join us on IRC: irc://irc.oftc.net/Kwort</p>

It toke quite some time, not because it was too much work, but because I didn't the enough time to finish it.
This new version includes the new authentication backend, and the new interface, which I have to say it's quite better than the old one. The main setuid program has a better comand line parser, not for the user, but if someone wants to understand it, is quite easy.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Christian Dywan for putting so much work in the graphical interface, he made an excellent job with it. I would like to thank too to all the people who reported bugs to make this release the best one.</p>

<br><a id="Why ktsuss use setuid"><br></a><a href="#Why ktsuss use setuid"><h3>Why ktsuss use setuid</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Feb 2008</h6><p>Well, this was the question made by one of the debian packagers. I see a good thing the fact that they ask this, since including a program setuid without asking the reasons would be kind of dumb. They ask why not using pam or su in the way gksu does, so I will try to answer these questions.</p>

<p>Using pam would requiere setuid too (since pam_unix2 doesn't have it's own wrapper), which doesn't bother me as long as I program in a secure way... What really does, is that not every distribution out there use pam, slackware is the most important it comes to my mind now.
Using su, well, there might be a problem there, gksu does it in a very unportable way waiting for the string " Authentication failure" which is a very bad idea, look this example:</p>

<pre><code>Fedora "su" command:
-sh-3.1$ su
Password:
su: incorrect password
-sh-3.1$
Slackware (Kwort) "su" command:
nomius@Neptune:~$ su
Password:
Sorry.
nomius@Neptune:~$
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in gksu, different versions of su would really break things up.
None of above shown implementations gives " Authentication failure". I guess that message is given by pam with strerror(), so once again, it's not portable.</p>

<p>The actual ktsuss code is very clean and simple (which is the whole idea behind ktsuss), I always gave security with the authentication backend, maybe a feature bug (like the PATH thing in 1.1), but not security issues.</p>

<p>There might be a way using su better than what gksu does, something like doing "su -c exit" (pepping the password of course) getting the exit status with WEXITSTATUS(), waiting for 0 (password ok and then run su command with the same password) or 1 (wrong password). But would be kind of messy...
I should see that like something in a long distant future... But I think it could be a way to avoid the paranoid.</p>

<p>So since ktsuss have its own implementation of authentication backend, that's why it needs setuid.</p>
