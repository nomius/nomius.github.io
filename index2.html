<p>Let's start with Kwort. Well we're just there from the release, lots of new improvements are being done around it, and something really interesting is the new network manager and the new user manager I wrote from scratch with a completely new design using gtkdialog.</p>

<p>The new network manager allows you to configure your ethernet and wireless network, supporting static and dhcp, for wireless network, support for several encryption mode are available, from wep to wpa2:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7bn3_3YdSWU/SZCvNk3odHI/AAAAAAAAANM/6m-TJD-_8Cw/knm.png" alt="Network manager" /></p>

<p>The user manager stills very simple but with a very simple and smooth interface:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7bn3_3YdSWU/SZCvNl6KKtI/AAAAAAAAANU/Q7Lh7X_hYTA/kum.png" alt="User manager" /></p>

<p>So, as you can see we have almost everything, since looking at the screenshot the Xfce settings manager is in it, so Xfce is kinda there, so you might be questioning "What are you waiting for a release?" Well, Xfce 4.6 is in release candidate time, so when they release it final we'll see how's the Mozilla people going with Firefox 3.1, since it would be really cool to ship it
with Kwort 2.4.1. I wouldn't matter to ship a beta 3 with 2.4.1, but we'll see, since beta 3 should be released already according to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3.1/Schedule">Mozilla's Firefox schedule</a>, and their delivery meeting is schedule to the end of the month (February 25th), which is just around the corner.</p>

<p>Resuming, lots of improvements are going on and I'm trying to make it pretty cool and easy for the end user.</p>

<p>That's just for Kwort, now... Some friends saw I was migrating to git, and yeah, I did, since in the past I used git with <a href="http://www.gitorious.org/">gitorious.org</a> which didn't convinced me, I came back to darcs. But now, I discovered <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> which is really cool, fast and easy to use and with lots of guides around, so you can see and follow my work
at: <a href="http://github.com/nomius">http://github.com/nomius</a>.</p>

<p>I have to admit here that I was influenced at work by warlock, which is the author of the <a href="http://www.warlockshome.com.ar/">wbar</a>, to move from darcs to git, so I found a darcs2git python script and it was like charm.</p>

<p>Also, I implemented lots of cool new features for kpkg, and I merged kpkg with the kwort network manager and user manager making a "big" project called <a href="http://github.com/nomius/kwtools/tree/master">kwtools</a>. Looking right now at the master tree page, you'll see this: "Implemented kpkg search /all with csv support" and you might be asking "What the hell is this guy making with kpkg implementing stuff like this?", well, I hope this feature is just enough, but basically, it is because a friend, x-ip, and I we are writing a graphical interface for kpkg, at the moment the interface is pretty rough but does show the idea, of course, icons and all that stuff is going to be implemented with also a more eye-candy interface, so you can see a preview of the application here:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7bn3_3YdSWU/SZCvNhGOhsI/AAAAAAAAANc/SV4rvaIufCg/galgo.png" alt="kpkg graphical" /></p>

<p>As I said before and as you can see, the interface looks pretty rough, but give us some time and you'll see how cool it looks. I doubt we get in time to include this new tool in Kwort 2.4.1, we'll try, but I really doubt it since I'm just learning python, which is the language we use to write this, and x-ip is just learning wxPython with me, which is the framework we use for
this.</p>

<p>Please, if you have any ideas for Kwort or any of the tools/applications I write, please write me, it would be nice to hear (read) about you and your ideas, and also, I don't know... help maybe? :-)</p>

<p>We'll, this post is already becoming large so I'm off to bed now. Have a nice week and see you around guys.</p>

<br><a id="Updates!"><br></a><a href="#Updates!"><h3>Updates!</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Nov 2008</h6><p>Well, it's been a long time in the road since my last post here. This weblog isn't over, but I been doing a lot of things and didn't got the time to write something.</p>

<p>Ok, things I've been doing:
* I wrote a new network manager for Kwort 2.4.2 (I'm already working on a new Kwort version), screenshots are coming
* I also wrote a new user manager for next Kwort also. Screenshots are ON the way. :-D
* A friend of mine (Jp) is working on a new init system which is very cool, so Kwort will use it.
* Bought a pretty cool (4 cores) new computer (Desktop). I would like to thank to the aircable.net people who helped me to buy my new computer with a donation. (A BIG THANKS TO YOU GUYS)
* Working... :-)</p>

<p>Anyways, I want here to point this link from my good old friend Andreas Schipplock, he made a small list of interesting links to read and/or hear.</p>

This is just a bug fix release and it is beta because of the new spamassassin plugin; I wrote this one on sunday, but since I don't use spamassassin (I have servers running dspam), I can't test it.</p>

<p>This is just a release asking for people to flood my inbox with feedback on the spamassassin plugin, the configuration parameters are the same used with the dspam plugin, so only "pass" parameter is allowed, or empty.</p>

<br><a id="NQqueue? What is that?"><br></a><a href="#NQqueue? What is that?"><h3>NQqueue? What is that?</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Jun 2008</h6><p>As some people asked me the last few weeks what I've been doing I've decided to take some time to write this and explain what NQqueue (aka nqq) is all about.
Well, some of you maybe listened (or read) me telling that queues for qmail are bloated. We don't have several choices, there is just plain qmail-queue which is unfeatured, qmail-scanner (aka give me my CPU back) which is the bloatest one, and simscan which is kind of featured, fast, but not extensible at all, both of the last ones are buggy when getting an email with several
Rcpts (they only analyze one. Which is a big bug).
So, because of all this, I've been using simscan, I actually extended it from those 2000 lines to 4000 adding features. But it became so big, that it is hard to maintain and to trace errors in it.
This situation drove me nuts the last year so I decided "Why I don't just write my own qmail queue?". Well, NQqueue is the result of this self asked question.</p>

<p>Let me show you and tell you some of the features of NQq:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modular - not like simscan with a big file with all the problem.</li>
<li>Pluggable - this is what NQq is all about, it support the addition of plugins. There are some now in the darcs server.</li>
<li>Threaded - this is quite a nice feature for mails with several Rcpts, nqqueue triggers a thread for every Rcpt to be analyzed.</li>
<li>Fast - This is like simscan. But it improves it when analyzing more than one Rcpt because of the threads.</li>
<li>Secure and reliable - I been working quite a lot on this, since simscan has several bugs, and I didn't want this on NQq.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plugins: Well, some of you might be asking "Dude, nice, but how do I write a plugin for NQq?". Well, first of all, I have to tell you that there are two types of plugins:
1st. we have the general plugins. Those plugins are run to an email before to trigger all the threads for every rcpt. Why is this? Well, it would be dumb to call for example a clamav plugin for every user (in every thread). So for example we can write a plugin that should not care about the Rcpts and/or From, like clamav, since it depends on a general database.
2nd. besides of general plugins, there are also per user plugins. These plugins are run in every thread. This is the example of a spam plugin, since it depends on a special per user database.</p>

<p>So now I can show you a small general plugin to block a Sender:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks easy don't you think? So, how do we make NQqueue to load our plugin? Simple: in /var/qmail/control/general.cfb put a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>:black=billgates@microsoft.com
</code></pre>

<p>That will set the sender billgates@microsoft.com as a blocked server. In fact, this plugin acts just like a black list.
Now your question might be: And how can I block more? Well, you can call the plugin several times, like this:</p>

<pre><code>:black=billgates@microsoft.com;black=steveballmer@microsoft.com
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can modify the plugin_init function to allow more than one email (like black=billgates@microsoft.com,steveballmer@microsoft.com) and do some simple parsing with strtok.</p>

<p>As you can see it is very easy to write plugins for NQqueue. I know it stills need a lot of documentation, since at it is now, it's very poor in this aspect. The only documentation in NQqueue so far is a configuration scheme in the NQqueue darcs in case you want to know how to configure it right (it's very easy).</p>

<p>So, those are some of the features in NQqueue there are more of course, but those are enough to mention.
NQqueue needs a lot of testing, so I'm counting with all of you to run tests. Also documentation is needed, and it will take some time to me to write it, so people wanting to write documentation are welcome. Also people writing plugins, I wrote some which are already in my darcs server (a dspam, clamav, blacklist and quarantine) modules.</p>

<br><a id="Hanging up switches and bridges"><br></a><a href="#Hanging up switches and bridges"><h3>Hanging up switches and bridges</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Apr 2008</h6><p>This issue came up today with some people and I did affirmed that you can hang up your switch with some funny code...
How this come? Well, very simple, switches and bridges has a small stack (10 bytes per host connected to it) where they save IP and MAC addresses to know where to send a package once the sender and the receiver are known. So, once the first package is sent, a new entry in the stack was made. So now you know the "theory" I'll leave you to think how could this help you to hang it (Let me give you a hint: OVERFLOW).</p>

<p>Anyways, get the code you'll need to produce this overflow from here: <a href="http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/pkinject">http://nomius.github.io/content/patches/pkinject</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that you'll need the pktgen kernel module to run this.
See also that I did this 3 years ago with bash, not even C code, so it shows how easy is to generate network packages to produce this effect, which isn't a big deal when it comes to reproduce it, but to create a security policy to avoid it.</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>

<p>The core system is based on Slackware and provides a rock solid system, and it's also a great place to start making a full featured and usable desktop environment using Xfce.
This version includes several changes from 2.2 from a new toolchain to a completely new base system. The inclusion of hal provides a great way to communicate the hardware with the desktop making the system a lot more user friendly.</p>

<p>Good things in this new version:
* Hal: As I said before provides a lot of new features giving the desktop some kind of control of the hardware.
* New init system: Kwort 2.4 includes a new init system written mostly from scratch. Also it puts all the work together with the new service command.
* Linux 2.6.24.3: The latest stable version of the linux kernel.
* Kpkg: The new version of kpkg was re-written from scratch.
* Kwort User Manager: Provides a simple way to create and remove users with default Kwort templates.
* Xfce: This new version integrate great with hal.
* Ristretto: The image viewer of the Xfce project.
* Mplayer: The most famous video player on Linux is now included in the iso.
* Pidgin: The latest version of the best multiprotocol IM.
* Mpd+Gmpc: This is the new combo to play media files in Kwort. Just put your media files in ~/Music, go to gmpc, give update and play.</p>

<p>As in every old version now comes the things that I look forward to improving:
* Better support for wireless devices: This is not part of Kwort itself, but the kernel, but finally affects Kwort users.
* Amule: Once again amule is giving the hebbe-jeebes. There is no stable version of amule that works well enough with Kwort. The latest version is dated from middle of 2006 wich is very old and buggy with newer versions of wxGTK.</p>

<p>People who I would like to thank:
Andreas Schipplock for making and maintaining the website, mirroring the iso, working in Kwort core (he made most part of the job with Core) and bring lzma support to Kwort.
Stijn Seger for working in some packages like openntpd and the pm support. And writing the Kwort user manager.
I would like to give a special thanks to the users who ran tests specially to David Luskovec and Juan Martin Villanueva, if it wasn't for you guys, this iso would take even longer to come out.
Manuel Naranjo for reporting bugs, submiting patches for the new init system, hosting the iso and run test all along Kwort core.
Also, I would like to thank all the mirror providers: Ricardo Brisighelli for the development mirror in the UNR, Alberto Ferrer for the mirror in Emanon Linux and the AIRcable people for the mirror at aircable.net.
Finally, but not less important a very big THANKS to Patrick Volkerding for Slackware Linux, the system kwort is based on. I hope I didn't forget anyone.</p>

<p>As usual, if you need support, help, or you just feel like talking about Kwort (or anything else), or you just want to meet the people who is behind Kwort, you can join us on IRC: irc://irc.oftc.net/Kwort</p>

<br><a id="ktsuss 1.3... Finally"><br></a><a href="#ktsuss 1.3... Finally"><h3>ktsuss 1.3... Finally</h3></a><h6>Posted on: Feb 2008</h6><p>Well, today I'm releasing the new ktsuss.
It toke quite some time, not because it was too much work, but because I didn't the enough time to finish it.
This new version includes the new authentication backend, and the new interface, which I have to say it's quite better than the old one. The main setuid program has a better comand line parser, not for the user, but if someone wants to understand it, is quite easy.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Christian Dywan for putting so much work in the graphical interface, he made an excellent job with it. I would like to thank too to all the people who reported bugs to make this release the best one.</p>
